# Drupal CMS with Hugo static site generation

Testing out building a hugo site from drupal content

## Setup

Install drupal CMS as per [CMS Quickstarts (ddev)](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal-drupal-cms), default ddev docs below:


Drupal CMS is a fast-moving open source product that enables site builders to easily create new Drupal sites and extend them with smart defaults, all using their browser.

## Getting started

If you want to use [DDEV](https://ddev.com) to run Drupal CMS locally, follow these instructions:

1. Install DDEV following the [documentation](https://ddev.com/get-started/)
2. Open the command line and `cd` to the root directory of this project
3. Run `ddev start`
4. Run `ddev launch`

`ddev start` runs this repo's bootstrap hook automatically. To recreate the Composer-managed Drupal CMS files manually at any time, run:

```sh
ddev composer bootstrap
```

That bootstrap command is a shortcut for `composer install` plus `composer drupal:recipe-unpack`, so it restores `vendor/`, Drupal core and contrib code under `web/`, scaffolded web-root files, and unpacked recipes from `composer.lock`.

Drupal CMS has the same system requirements as Drupal core, so you can use your preferred setup to run it locally. [See the Drupal User Guide for more information](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/installation-chapter.html) on how to set up Drupal.

### Installation options

The Drupal CMS installer offers a list of features preconfigured with smart defaults. You will be able to customize whatever you choose, and add additional features, once you are logged in.

After the installer is complete, you will land on the dashboard.
